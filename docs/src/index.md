# DiffusionDefinition.jl

This is a small utility package for defining diffusion processes and sampling from their laws. It is created to work in conjunction with a suite of packages in [JuliaDiffusionBayes](https://github.com/JuliaDiffusionBayes) to provide tools for Bayesian inference for diffusion processes.

To get started [see how to define diffusion processes with this package](/overview/defining_diffusions)
